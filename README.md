# Python-week-5-assignment-
# Medical Student & Food Polymorphism Program

This Python project demonstrates **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** principles such as:

- **Class creation**
- **Inheritance**
- **Constructors**
- **Encapsulation**
- **Polymorphism**

The project includes two main parts:

---

## Assignment 1: Medical Student Class

This part simulates a medical student with realistic attributes like:
- Name, year, school, specialty interest
- GPA and sleep hours
- Mood based on sleep

### Features
- `introduce()` – introduces the student
- `study(subject, hours)` – simulates study hours
- `attend_class()` – shows class or rotation activity
- `take_exam(subject)` – simulates taking an exam
- `check_status()` – checks student mood and sleep level

It also includes a subclass **ClinicalStudent** to demonstrate inheritance and polymorphism.

## Activity 2: Food Polymorphism

This section demonstrates polymorphism using a base class `Food` and subclasses:
- `Pizza`
- `Soup`
- `IceCream`

Each subclass overrides the `eat()` method to show how different food types are eaten.
